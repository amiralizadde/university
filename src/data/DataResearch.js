    explain:
      "A well-known non-contact method for microscopic manipulation is optical tweezers. However, recent studies have shown that the potential of microscopic trapping can be expanded by using high-frequency standing sound waves, called acoustic tweezers. Acoustic tweezers are biocompatible and can trap larger particles compared to the optical tweezers while the heat-damaging effect is much less. Here, we characterize acoustic tweezers to trap particles with the few tens of micrometers produced by a homemade acoustic device.",

    explain:
      "A dual-beam optical tweezers setup consists of two focused laser beams that could be used to trap two different objects or to trap a large particle like a suspended cell in 3D. Two traps could move independently in solution and this makes it possible to probe the mechanical properties of suspended cells (in 3D). Here, we engaged in developing dual-beam optical tweezers for biological application.",
